# Encoding Message Blocks

To use a code to send messages, we must define a mapping from a bit vector, **s**, of length _K_, representing a source message, to a codeword, **x**, of length _N_>_K_. We will consider only linear mappings, which can be written in the form **x**=**G**<sup><small>T</small></sup>**s**, where **G** is a _generator matrix_. For a code with parity check matrix **H**, whose codewords satisfy **Hx**=**0**, the generator matrix must satisfy **HG**<sup><small>T</small></sup>=**0**. This software assumes that the number of rows in the parity check matrix, _M_, is equal to _N-K_, as would normally be the case.

This software deals only with _systematic_ encodings, in which the _K_ bits of **s** are copied unchanged to some subset of the _N_ bits of **x** (the _message bits_), and the remaining _M=N-K_ _check bits_ of **x** are then set so as to make the result a codeword. For a linear code, a systematic encoding scheme always exists, for some choice of which bits of a codeword are message bits. It is conventional to rearrange the order of the bits in a codeword so that the message bits come first. The first _K_ columns of the _K_ by _N_ generator matrix will then be the identity matrix.

However, this software does _not_ assume that the message bits come first, since different encoding methods prefer different locations for the message bits. Instead, a vector of indexes of where each message bit is located within a codeword is recorded in a file along with a representation of the part of the generator matrix that produces the check bits. More than one such generator matrix file can be created for a single parity check file, in which the locations of the message bits may be different. Decoding of a received message into a codeword (with [<tt>decode</tt>](decoding.html#decode)) does not depend on knowing which are the message bits, though this does need to be known in order to reconstruct the original message (with [<tt>extract</tt>](decoding.html#extract)).

This software stores representations of generator matrices in files in a format that is not human-readable (except by using the [<tt>print-gen</tt>](#print-gen) program). However, these files _are_ readable on a machine with a different architecture than they were written on.<a name="gen-rep"></a>

## <a name="gen-rep">Generator matrix representations</a>

For simplicity of exposition, it will be assumed for the next few paragraphs that the message bits are located at the _end_ of the codeword, so a codeword can be divided into _M_ check bits, **c**, followed by _K_ message bits, **s**.

On the above assumption, the parity check matrix, **H**, can be divided into an _M_ by _M_ matrix **A** occupying the first _M_ columns of **H** and an _M_ by _K_ matrix **B** occupying the remaining columns of **H**. The requirement that a codeword, **x**, satisfy all parity checks (ie, that **Hx**=**0**) can then be written as

> **Ac** + **Bs** = **0**

Provided that **A** is non-singular, it follows that

> **c** = **A**<sup><small>-1</small></sup>**Bs**

**A** may be singular for some choices of which codeword bits are message bits, but a choice for which **A** is non-singular always exists if the rows of **H** are linearly independent. It is possible, however, that the rows of **H** are not linearly independent (ie, some rows are redundant). This is an exceptional and not particularly interesting case, which is mostly ignored in the descriptions below; see the discussion of [linear dependence in parity check matrices](dep-H.html) for the details.

The equation **c** = **A**<sup><small>-1</small></sup>**Bs** defines what the check bits should be, but actual computation of these check bits can be done in several ways, three of which are implemented in this software. Each method involves a different representation of the generator matrix. (Note that none of these methods involves the explicit representation of the matrix **G** mentioned above.)

In the _dense representation_, the _M_ by _K_ matrix **A**<sup><small>-1</small></sup>**B** is computed, and stored in a dense format (see the [dense modulo-2 matrix package](mod2dense.html)). A message is encoded by multiplying the source bits, **s**, by this matrix to obtain the required check bits.

In the _mixed representation_, the _M_ by _M_ matrix **A**<sup><small>-1</small></sup> is computed and stored in a dense format, and the _M_ by _K_ matrix **B**, the right portion of the parity check matrix, is also stored, in a sparse format (see the [sparse modulo-2 matrix package](mod2sparse.html)). To encode a message, the source vector **s** is first multiplied on the left by **B**, an operation which can be done very quickly if **B** is sparse (as it will be for LDPC codes). The result is then multiplied on the left by **A**<sup><small>-1</small></sup>. If _M_<_K_, the total time may be less than when using the dense representation above.

The _sparse representation_ goes further, and avoids explicitly computing **A**<sup><small>-1</small></sup>, which tends to be dense even if **H** is sparse. Instead, a _LU decomposition_ of **A** is found, consisting of a lower triangular matrix **L** and an upper triangular matrix **U** for which **LU**=**A**. The effect of multiplying **Bs**=**z** by **A**<sup><small>-1</small></sup> can then be obtained by

> Solving **Ly**=**z** for **y** using forward substitution.  
> Solving **Uc**=**y** for **c** using backward substitution.

Both of these operations will be fast if **L** and **U** are sparse. Heuristics are used to try to achieve this, by rearranging the rows and columns of **H** in the process of selecting **A** and finding its LU decomposition.

<a name="make-gen">Finds a generator matrix for the code whose parity check matrix is in <tt>_pchk-file_</tt>, and writes a representation of this generator matrix to <tt>_gen-file_</tt>. The remaining arguments specify what representation of the generator matrix is to be used (see the</a> [description above](#gen-rep)), and the method to be used in finding it. A message regarding the density of 1s in the resulting representation is displayed on standard error. For a sparse representation, a smaller number of 1s will produce faster encoding.

All representations include a specification for how the columns of the parity check matrix should be re-ordered so that the message bits come last. References to columns of the parity check matrix below refer to their order after this reordering. For the _dense_ and _mixed_ representations, an <tt>_other-gen-file_</tt> may be specified, in which case the ordering of columns will be the same as the ordering stored in that file (which must produce a non-singular **A** matrix; redundant rows of **H** are not allowed with this option). Otherwise, <tt>make-gen</tt> decides on an appropriate ordering of columns itself. Note that the column rearrangement is recorded as part of the representation of the generator matrix; the parity check matrix as stored in its file is not altered.

The _dense_ representation consists of a dense representation of the matrix **A**<sup><small>-1</small></sup>**B**, where **A** is the matrix consisting of the first _M_ columns (after reordering) of the parity check matrix, and **B** is the remaining columns. If **H** contains redundant rows, there is an additional reordering of columns of **A** in order create the same effect as if the redundant rows came last.

The _mixed_ representation consists of a dense representation of the matrix **A**<sup><small>-1</small></sup>, where **A** is the matrix consisting of the first _M_ columns (after reordering) of the parity check matrix. The remaining columns of the parity check matrix, making up the matrix **B**, are also part of the representation, but are not written to <tt>_gen-file_</tt>, since they can be obtained from <tt>_pchk-file_</tt>. As for mixed representations, an additional reordering of columns of **A** may be needed if **H** has redundant rows.

A _sparse_ representation consists of sparse representations of the **L** and **U** matrices, whose product is **A**, the first _M_ columns of the parity check matrix (whose columns and rows may both have been reordered). The matrix **B**, consisting of the remaining columns of the parity check matrix, is also part of the representation, but it is not written to <tt>_gen-file_</tt>, since it can be obtained from <tt>_pchk-file_</tt>.

If a sparse representation is chosen, arguments after <tt>sparse</tt> specify what heuristic is used when reordering columns and rows in order to try to make **L** and **U** as sparse as possible. The default if no heuristic is specified is <tt>minprod</tt>. If the <tt>_abandon-num_</tt> and <tt>_abandon-when_</tt> options are given, some information is discarded in order to speed up the process of finding **L** and **U**, at a possible cost in terms of how good a result is obtained. For details on these heuristics, see the descriptions of [sparse LU decomposition methods](sparse-LU.html).

**Example:** A dense representation of a generator matrix for the Hamming code created by the example for [<tt>make-pchk</tt>](pchk.html#make-pchk) can be created as follows:

<pre>*   make-gen ham7.pchk ham7.gen dense
    Number of 1s per check in Inv(A) X B is 3.0
    </pre>

</a>

<a name="print-gen">Prints in human-readable form the representation of the generator matrix that is stored in <tt>_gen-file_</tt>. The **-d** option causes the matrices involved to be printed in a dense format, even if they are stored in the file in a sparse format. See the</a> [description above](#gen-rep) for details of generator matrix representations. Note that the **L** matrix for a sparse representation will be lower triangular only after the rows are rearranged, and the **U** matrix will be upper triangular only after the columns are rearranged. The matrix **B** that is part of the sparse and mixed representations is not printed, since it is not stored in the <tt>_gen-file_</tt>, but is rather a subset of columns of the parity check matrix.

**Example:** The generator matrix for the Hamming code created by the example for [<tt>make-gen</tt>](#make-gen) can be printed as follows:

<pre>*   print-gen ham7.gen

    Generator matrix (dense representation):

    Column order:

       0   1   2   3   4   5   6

    Inv(A) X B:

     1 1 1 0
     1 1 0 1
     0 1 1 1
    </pre>

For this example, the columns did not need to be rearranged, and hence the message bits will be in positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 of a codeword.

<a name="encode"></a>

<a name="encode">**encode**: Encode message blocks as codewords

> <pre>encode [ -f ] _pchk-file gen-file source-file encoded-file_
> </pre>

Encodes message blocks of length _K_, read from <tt>_source-file_</tt>, as codewords of length _N_, which are written to <tt>_encoded-file_</tt>, replacing any previous data in this file. Here, _N_ is the number of columns in the parity check matrix in <tt>_pchk-file_</tt>, and _K_=_N-M_, where _M_ is the number of rows in the parity check matrix. The generator matrix used, from <tt>_gen-file_</tt>, determines which bits of the codeword are set to the message bits, and how the remaining check bits are computed. The generator matrix is created from <tt>_pchk-file_</tt> using</a> [<tt>make-gen</tt>](#make-gen).

A newline is output at the end of each block written to <tt>_encoded-file_</tt>. Newlines in <tt>_source-file_</tt> are ignored.

If the **-f** option is given, output to <tt>_encoded-file_</tt> is flushed after each block. This allows one to use encode as a server, reading blocks to encode from a named pipe, and writing the encoded block to another named pipe.
